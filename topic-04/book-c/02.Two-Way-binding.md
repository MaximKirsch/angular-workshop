# Two-Way-Binding

# Introduction
In Angular, two-way binding allows for data to flow in both directions, from the component class to the template and vice versa. This is useful for creating interactive forms where user input needs to update the model and the view simultaneously.

## How Two-Way Binding Works
Two-way binding in Angular is achieved using the `[(ngModel)]` directive. This directive combines property binding and event binding to synchronize the data between the component class and the template.

### Example
Let's look at an example where we use two-way binding to bind an input field to a component property.

#### Component

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-two-way-binding',
  template: `
    <h1>Two-Way Binding Example</h1>
    <input [(ngModel)]="name" />
    <p>Hello, {{ name }}!</p>
  `,
})
export class TwoWayBindingComponent {
  name: string = 'Angular';
}
```
In this example, the  `TwoWayBindingComponent` uses `[(ngModel)]` to bind the name property to the input field, allowing for two-way data binding.

## Detailed Explanation

### Two-Way Binding with ngModel

The `[(ngModel)]` directive binds the input field to the component property, and updates the property whenever the input value changes.

```html
<input [(ngModel)]="name" />
```

This is equivalent to combining property binding and event binding:

```html
<input [ngModel]="name" (ngModelChange)="name = $event" />
```
## Conclusion

Two-way binding in Angular is a powerful feature that simplifies the process of creating interactive and dynamic forms. By understanding and using the `[(ngModel)]` directive, you can ensure that your data is always in sync between the component class and the template.
