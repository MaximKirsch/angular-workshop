# One-Way-Binding

## Introduction
In Angular, one-way binding refers to the flow of data from the component class to the template. This ensures that the displayed data is always in sync with the component class.

## How One-Way Binding Works
One-way binding in Angular can be achieved using interpolation or property binding. Interpolation binds data from the component class to the template, while property binding binds component properties to DOM properties.

### Example
Let's look at an example where we use one-way binding to display a message from the component class in the template.

#### Component

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-one-way-binding',
  template: `
    <h1>One-Way Binding Example</h1>
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
    <input [value]="message" />
  `,
})
export class OneWayBindingComponent {
  message: string = 'Hello, Angular!';
}
```
In this example, the `OneWayBindingComponent` binds the `message` property to a paragraph element using interpolation and to an input element using property binding.

## Detailed Explanation

### Interpolation

Interpolation is used to bind a component property to the template. It is done by enclosing the property name in double curly braces (`{{}}`).

```html
<p>{{ message }}</p>
```

### Property Binding
Property binding is used to bind a component property to a DOM property. It is done by enclosing the property name in square brackets (`[]`).

```html
<input [value]="message" />
```
In both cases, the data flows from the component class to the template, ensuring the view is updated whenever the component property changes.

## Conclusion

One-way binding in Angular is a straightforward way to keep the view in sync with the component class. By understanding and using interpolation and property binding, you can create dynamic and responsive Angular applications.
