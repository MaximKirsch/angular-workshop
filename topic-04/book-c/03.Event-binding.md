# Event binding

## Introduction
In Angular, event binding is used to listen to events such as clicks, key presses, and mouse movements, and respond to them by executing a method in the component class. This enables the creation of dynamic and interactive web applications.

## How Event Binding Works
Event binding in Angular is achieved using parentheses `()` around the event name in the template. This binds the event to a method in the component class.

### Example
Let's look at an example where we bind a button click event to a method in the component class.

#### Component

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-event-binding',
  template: `
    <h1>Event Binding Example</h1>
    <button (click)="onClick()">Click Me</button>
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
  `,
})
export class EventBindingComponent {
  message: string = '';

  onClick(): void {
    this.message = 'Button clicked!';
  }
}
```
In this example, the `EventBindingComponent` listens for the button's `click` event and executes the `onClick` method when the button is clicked.

## Detailed Explanation

### Step 1: Bind the Event in the Template
In the template, use parentheses `()` around the event name to bind the event to a method in the component class.

```html
<button (click)="onClick()">Click Me</button>
```
### Step 2: Define the Method in the Component Class
In the component class, define the method that should be executed when the event occurs.
```typescript
onClick(): void {
  this.message = 'Button clicked!';
}
````

## Conclusion

Event binding in Angular is a powerful feature that allows you to create interactive web applications by responding to user actions. By understanding and using event binding, you can create dynamic and responsive Angular applications.
