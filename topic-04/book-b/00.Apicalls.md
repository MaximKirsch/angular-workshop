# Api Calls

Calling API's and receiving JSON-Data

## Introduction

This guide covers how to make API calls and create services for handling these calls in an Angular project. Services in Angular are a great way to share data and functionality across different parts of your application.

first off:
**HttpClientModule**: Ensure the `HttpClientModule` is imported in your `AppModule`:
```typescript
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

    @NgModule({
      declarations: [AppComponent],
      imports: [BrowserModule, HttpClientModule],
      providers: [],
      bootstrap: [AppComponent]
    })
    export class AppModule { }
    ```
