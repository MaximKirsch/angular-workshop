# Lazy Loading

Sometimes you have to wait for data to arrive from some API

You're SPA-Component won't load if there isn't anything that indicates
that it has to wait for the data to arrive.

Introducing "Lazy Loading"

# Lazy Loading with loadChildren and loadComponent

loadChildren is used to lazy load modules. This can help to reduce the initial bundle size by loading modules only when needed.

```typescript
    const routes: Routes = [
    { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
    { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
    { path: 'feature', loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule) }
];
```

loadComponent is used to lazy load standalone components directly without needing a module.

```typescript
    const routes: Routes = [
    { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
    { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
    { path: 'lazy', loadComponent: () => import('./lazy/lazy.component').then(c => c.LazyComponent) }
];
```
