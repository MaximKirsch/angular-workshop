# Install and Set up

To install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run the following command:

```javascript
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

On Windows client computers, the execution of PowerShell scripts is disabled by default, so the above command may fail with an error. To allow the execution of PowerShell scripts, which is needed for npm global binaries, you must set the following execution policy:

```javascript
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
