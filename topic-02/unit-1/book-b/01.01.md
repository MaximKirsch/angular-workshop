# Install and Set up

To install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

On Windows client computers, the execution of PowerShell scripts is disabled by default, so the above command may fail with an error. To allow the execution of PowerShell scripts, which is needed for npm global binaries, you must set the following execution policy:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

On some Unix-like setups, global npm scripts may be owned by the root user, so to the above command may fail with a permission error. Run with `sudo` to execute the command as the root user and enter your password when prompted:

```bash
sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
```
