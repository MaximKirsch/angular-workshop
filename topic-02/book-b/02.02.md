# src Folder

The `src` folder is the main container for your application source code. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

### app

The `app` folder contains the core files of your application:

- **app.component.ts**: The root component of your application.
- **app.module.ts**: The root module that bootstraps the application.
- **app-routing.module.ts**: Handles routing configuration (if generated with routing).

You can add other components, services, and modules here as your application grows.

### assets

The `assets` folder is where you store static assets such as images, icons, and other resources that need to be served with the application.

### environments

The `environments` folder contains environment-specific configuration files:

- **environment.ts**: Default configuration.
- **environment.prod.ts**: Configuration for production builds.

### styles

The `styles` folder is where you define global styles for your application. The `styles.scss` (or `styles.css`) file is the main stylesheet for your project.

### index.html

The `index.html` file is the main entry point of your application. It contains the root HTML structure and where the Angular application gets bootstrapped.

### main.ts

The `main.ts` file is the main entry point for the Angular application. It bootstraps the `AppModule`.
