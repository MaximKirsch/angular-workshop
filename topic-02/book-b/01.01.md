# Anatomy of an Angular Project

When you initialize a new Angular project using the Angular CLI, it creates a structured folder layout that serves as the foundation for your application. Understanding this structure is crucial for efficient development and maintenance of your Angular project. In this article, we'll explore the primary components of the folder structure and their purposes.

## Project Root

At the root level of your Angular project, you'll find several configuration files and folders that are essential for your project setup:

-angular.json: Configuration file for Angular CLI with information about project structure, build options, and more.
-package.json: Contains metadata about your project, including dependencies and scripts.
-tsconfig.json: TypeScript configuration file.
-README.md: Default project documentation.
-.gitignore: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore in the project.
