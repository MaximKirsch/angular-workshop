# Preparing Your Angular Application for Deployment

Before deploying your Angular application to Netlify, you need to ensure it is built and optimized for production.

## Step 1: Build Your Angular Application

Run the following command to build your application for production:

```sh
ng build --prod
```

This command will compile your Angular application and generate the necessary files in the `dist/` directory.

## Step 2: Verify the Build Output

Navigate to the dist/ directory and verify that the build was successful. You should see a folder named after your Angular project. This folder contains all the files that need to be deployed.

```sh
cd dist/
ls
```
