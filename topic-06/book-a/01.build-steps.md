# Steps in the Angular Build Process

When you run the `ng build` command, the Angular CLI performs several steps to compile and optimize your application. Here are the main steps involved in the build process:

## Step 1: Reading Configuration

The Angular CLI reads the `angular.json` configuration file to determine the build settings, including file replacements, optimization options, and output paths.

## Step 2: TypeScript Compilation

The TypeScript code in your application is compiled into JavaScript using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). This step converts your TypeScript files into JavaScript files that can be executed by a web browser.

## Step 3: Angular Compiler (AOT Compilation)

For production builds, the Angular compiler performs Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation. This step compiles your Angular templates and components into efficient JavaScript code at build time, reducing the workload at runtime and improving application performance.

## Step 4: Asset Optimization

Assets such as images, stylesheets, and other static files are optimized. This includes minification, compression, and hashing of file names to ensure efficient loading and caching.

## Step 5: Bundling

The compiled JavaScript files are bundled together using Webpack. Bundling combines multiple files into a single file (or a few files) to reduce the number of HTTP requests needed to load the application.

## Step 6: Minification and Uglification

The JavaScript bundles are minified and uglified to reduce their size. Minification removes unnecessary whitespace and comments, while uglification renames variables and functions to shorter names.

## Step 7: Output Generation

The final output files, including HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and optimized assets, are generated in the `dist/` directory (or the directory specified in the configuration). These files are
