# Angular Build Process

The build process in Angular is essential for preparing your application for deployment. It involves compiling your TypeScript code, optimizing assets, and packaging everything into a format that can be efficiently served by a web server. In this guide, we'll cover the basics of the Angular build process and the commands involved.

## Build Commands

Angular CLI provides several commands to build your application:

- **ng build**: Compiles the application into an output directory.
- **ng build --prod**: Builds the application for production with optimizations.

## Build Configuration

The build configurations are defined in the `angular.json` file. This file contains settings for different environments (e.g., development, production) and allows customization of the build process.

### Example

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "your-app": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "configurations": {
            "production": {
              "optimization": true,
              "outputHashing": "all",
              "sourceMap": false,
              "extractCss": true,
              "namedChunks": false,
              "aot": true,
              "extractLicenses": true,
              "vendorChunk": false,
              "buildOptimizer": true,
              "fileReplacements": [
                {
                  "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
                  "with": "src/environments/environment.prod.ts"
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the next file, we will explore the steps involved in the build process when you run the `ng build` command.
