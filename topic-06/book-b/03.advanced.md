# Advanced Netlify Settings for Your Angular Application

After deploying your Angular application to Netlify, you may want to configure additional settings such as custom domains, environment variables, and redirects. Here's how you can do that.

## Custom Domain

### Step 1: Add a Custom Domain

1. Go to the **"Domain settings"** section of your site on Netlify.
2. Click on **"Add custom domain"**.
3. Enter your custom domain name and follow the instructions to verify ownership.

### Step 2: Configure DNS

Update your DNS provider with the records provided by Netlify to point your custom domain to your Netlify site.

### Continuous Deployment

Netlify automatically redeploys your site whenever you push changes to your Git repository. Ensure that your `ng build --prod` command and publish directory are correctly configured for smooth continuous deployment.
