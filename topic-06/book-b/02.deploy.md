# Deploying to Netlify

With your application built and your code committed, you can now deploy your Angular application to Netlify.

## Step 1: Login to Netlify

Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and log in to your account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for free.

## Step 2: Create a New Site

1. Click on the **"New site from Git"** button on the Netlify dashboard.
2. Select your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) and authenticate Netlify with your Git account.
3. Choose the repository containing your Angular project.

## Step 3: Configure Build Settings

1. **Branch to deploy**: Select the branch you want to deploy (e.g., `main`).
2. **Build command**: `ng build --prod`
3. **Publish directory**: `dist/your-project-name`

Replace `your-project-name` with the actual name of the folder generated in the `dist` directory.

### Example Configuration

- **Build command**: `ng build --prod`
- **Publish directory**: `dist/my-angular-app`

## Step 4: Deploy the Site

Click the **"Deploy site"** button. Netlify will start the build and deployment process. This may take a few minutes.

## Step 5: Verify Deployment

Once the deployment is complete, Netlify will provide a URL where your Angular application is hosted. Open this URL in your browser to verify that your application is running correctly.

In the next file, we will cover how to configure custom domains and advanced settings on Netlify.
