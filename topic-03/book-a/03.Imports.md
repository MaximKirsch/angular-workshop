# How the TypeScript File Knows the Other Files

The TypeScript file (`component-name.component.ts`) generated for your component is the central point that ties together the template, styles, and logic. Let's explore how it references the other files.

## Component Decorator

The `@Component` decorator in the TypeScript file is used to define metadata for the component. This metadata includes the selector, template URL, and style URLs, which link to the corresponding HTML and CSS/SCSS files.

### Example

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-component-name",
  templateUrl: "./component-name.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./component-name.component.scss"],
})
export class ComponentNameComponent {
  // Component logic goes here
}
```

## Metadata Properties

Metadata Properties

1. selector: Defines the custom HTML tag for the component. This tag can be used to embed the component in other templates.

```typescript
selector: "app-component-name";
```

2. templateUrl: Specifies the path to the HTML file for the component's template.

```typescript
templateUrl: "./component-name.component.html";
```

3. styleUrls: Specifies an array of paths to the CSS/SCSS files for the component's styles.

```typescript
styleUrls: ["./component-name.component.scss"];
```

## Import Statements

The TypeScript file also uses import statements to include necessary Angular core features and other dependencies.

#### Example

```typescript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";
```

This statement imports the Component symbol from the @angular/core package, which is necessary to define an Angular component.

## Conclusion

The @Component decorator is the key element that connects the TypeScript file with the HTML and CSS/SCSS files, allowing Angular to render and style the component properly. In the next file, we will cover some additional considerations and best practices when working with Angular components.
