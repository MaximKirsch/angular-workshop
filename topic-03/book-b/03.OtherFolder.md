# Public & node_modules folder

## node_modules

The `node_modules` folder contains all the npm packages installed as dependencies for your project. This folder is generated when you run `npm install` and should not be manually edited. This directory can become quite large as it includes all the dependencies and sub-dependencies needed for your project.

## public

The `public` folder is where you can store static files that you want to be publicly accessible. This can include static HTML files, images, and other assets that do not need to be processed by Webpack. Unlike the `assets` folder, files in the `public` directory are not processed or bundled by Angular.
